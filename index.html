			<p class="intro">“If Taylor Swift were an economy, she’d be bigger than 50 countries,” says Dan Fleetwood, President of QuestionPro Research and Insights. A study from QuestionPro also states that the average Taylor Swift concert attendee has spent $1,328 to go for one of her shows.

				According to NBC Los Angeles, the 6 nights of the sold-out shows in LA were believed to cause a $320 million bump to the county’s GDP through direct, indirect and induced impacts. Swifties not only spend on concert tickets, hotels and food but also on costumes, merchandise, and Taylor-themed everything.
